* wunderground
  This library is an attempt to provide a reasonably safe and
  performant set of API bindings to the [[http://wunderground.com][WUnderground]] weather API. It
  is designed in applications, so it is easy to use in pre-existing
  monad transformer stacks.
* Status
  Currently, =wunderground= does not support all of the APIs or fields
  provided by the WUnderground API. Part of that is due to
  prioritizing exactly the APIs that were needed for a business use
  case and part of it has to do with ambiguous documentation about the
  meanings and possible values of several fields.
* Tasks
** TODO Travis CI
** TODO Other APIs besides weather-by-coords
** TODO Fill out more missing fields
